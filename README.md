# Project System Modeling and Simulation

## Description

System modeling and simulation is an approach used to understand, analyze, and predict the behavior of complex real-world systems. These systems can be physical, such as a manufacturing plant or an electrical network, or they can be non-physical systems, such as an economy or a business process.
